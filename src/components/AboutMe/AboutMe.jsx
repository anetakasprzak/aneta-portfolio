        During one of the lockdowns I found my passion for coding - started with
        playful exploration of HTML and CSS. The magic of coding captivated me,
        leading me to leave my hospitality job and plunge into the world of
        development. <br />I did JavaScript and React courses, spent countless
        hours making side projects to practice and focus to turn my passion into
        full time job as a React Developer.

        Beyond the screen, you&apos;ll find me in the kitchen, cooking and
        eating is my second big passion.
        <br /> When I&apos;m not sitting at my desk, I&apos;m lifting weights at
        the gym.
